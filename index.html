        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone!

          I am Dharmi Hemani. I pursued Computer Science as my undergrad major and I graduated in 2021 with BE. Computer Science. Post my undergrad, I started working at Accenture as an Application Development Associate where I used technologies like UFT(automation tool), Python Selenium, SAP and a little bit of Java. Keeping the professional life aside, a little bit about me; I am a food enthusiast, I enjoy exploring new restaurants and new cuisines. Apart from that, I like to travel and cook.
          
          While I was working for Accenture, I was given a task to retrieve certain aspects of a dataset which I could use for automation. With my background in database management, I understood the technical terms of it but I wasn't able to implement those as per the client's requirement. That's when I decided to pursue Master's in Information Technology, so I could bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical aspects. I expect to gain  and learn various tools and concepts of database management and analytics with hands on exercises and projects.</p>
